    "## Key Components of the Model\n",
    "1. **Economic Growth Correlation**: The model uses an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to establish a relationship between the global space economy (GSE) and the growth rate of trackable objects in space.\n",
    "2. **Growth Rate Calculation**: The base growth rate $(g^T)$ of trackable objects is computed using the average GSE growth rate of 5% from 2011-2022. The commercialized growth rate $(g^{T_c})$ considers an increased economic activity with a projected growth rate of 8.2%.\n",
    "3. **Collision Debris**: The model estimates additional debris created by collisions, using a Poisson distribution to predict the probability of collisions.\n",

    "    - Commercialized growth rate: $( g^{T_c} = ϵ^T \\cdot G^{T_c} = 1.3 \\cdot 8.2\\% = 10.3\\%)$\n",

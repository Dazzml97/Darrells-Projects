# Space Debris Projection Model

This project is based on the research paper "The Cost of (Un)regulation: Shrinking Earthâ€™s Orbits and the Need for Sustainable Space Governance." 

## Project Overview
The paper discusses the growing issue of space debris in Earth's orbits and the need for sustainable space governance. It highlights the risks associated with the increasing number of satellites and debris, emphasizing that Earth's orbit is a limited resource at risk of becoming unusable if current trends continue.

## Key Points
### Space Sustainability: 
The Earth's orbit is a unique Area Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), and the increasing number of satellites and space debris pose significant sustainability challenges.
### Growth Trajectory Model: 
A probability-based empirical model was developed to project the growth of objects in space. The findings indicate that we are approaching a 'critical density' threshold, beyond which the risk of collisions and the resulting debris will make orbits unusable.
### Active Debris Removal (ADR): 
The study estimates the potential costs of active debris removal measures. While ADR technologies can delay the critical density threshold, they alone are not sufficient for long-term orbital sustainability.
### Regulatory Framework: 
The research argues for the need for a radical revision of the international regulatory framework to ensure the sustainable use of Earth's orbits.
Usage

The model and data in this repository can be used to simulate the growth of space debris and assess the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. It serves as a tool for policymakers and researchers interested in space sustainability and the economics of space governance
